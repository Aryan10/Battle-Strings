This is a research in which I am working on.
My main goal is to change all the battle text to match Generation 7.

This project is usable for FireRed & Emerlad. And it's also started for Ruby.
Please contribute with any text offset, buffer or text changes done in Gen 7. Your contribution will be added and you will be credited for it.

Special Thanks to Bulbapedia for GBA Character encoding.

If you want to use it in your hack, insert New Code somewhere in free space and replace the pointers with the offset(where you inserted new code) in reverse hex.

Be sure to credit the other people involved in this project.
